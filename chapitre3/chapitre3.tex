\chapter[Uncertain time series u-shapelet discovery]{Frobenius correlation based u-shapelets discovery for time series clustering}
\label{fots}

\begin{abstract}
An unsupervised shapelet (u-shapelet) is a sub-sequence of a time series used for clustering a time series dataset. The purpose of this chapter  is to discover u-shapelets on uncertain time series. To achieve this goal, we propose a dissimilarity score robust to uncertainty called FOTS whose computation is based on the eigenvector decomposition and the comparison of the autocorrelation matrices of the time series. This score is robust to the presence of uncertainty; it is not very sensitive to transient changes; it allows capturing complex relationships between time series such as oscillations and trends, and it is also well adapted to the comparison of short time series. The FOTS score has been  used with the Scalable Unsupervised Shapelet Discovery algorithm for the clustering of 17 datasets, and it has shown a substantial improvement in the quality of  clustering with respect to the Rand Index. This work defines a novel framework for  clustering of uncertain time series.

\section{Introduction}
All measurements performed by a mechanical system contain uncertainty. Indeed, the uncertainty principle is partly a statement about the limitations of mechanical systems ability to perform measurements on a system without disturbing it \cite{folland1997uncertainty}. Thus, time series obtained from sensors are unavoidably uncertain. These time series  constitute a vast proportion of the data used in science, as in medicine with ECGs, in physics with measurements recorded by telescopes, or in computing with the Internet of Things and so on. Ignoring the uncertainty of the data
during their analysis can lead to rough or inaccurate conclusions, hence the need to implement uncertain data management techniques. 



Several recent studies have focused on the processing of uncertainty in data mining. Two main approaches allow to take uncertainty into account in data mining tasks: either it is taken into account during the comparison by using appropriate distance functions \cite{Rizvandi2013, Hwang2014, Rehfeld2014, Orang2014, Wang2015, Orang2017}, or its impact is reduced by transformations performed on the data
\cite{Orang2015}. This latter strategy is used natively by the u-shapelet algorithm.

\subsection{Review of u-shapelets}


Let us consider a data set consisting of 6 time series corresponding to two birds' calls: 3 time series corresponding to \textcolor{green}{Olive-sided Flycatcher} (green)and three time series corresponding to calls of \textcolor{blue}{White-crowned Sparrow} (blue). When these time series are classified using Euclidean distance as a measure of dissimilarity  the groups obtained are not homogeneous (Fig. \ref{US} left); in other words, it's not possible to recognize the bird from its calls. However, if  characteristic sub-sequences (u-shapelets) are considered  to classify time series, we obtain more homogeneous groups than with Euclidean distance (Fig. \ref{US} right).
  
 \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{images/exemple_shapelet}
    \caption{Example of classification of time series of two birds' calls (green: Olive-sided Flycatcher; blue: White-crowned Sparrow) using on the one hand the Euclidean distance(left), and on the other hand the u-shapelet (right) \cite{ulanova2015scalable}}
  \label{US}
 \end{figure}
 

Once this feature has been observed, the natural question is how to find the sub-sequences that characterize a group of times series, that is, the sub-sequences that are observed only in a time series subgroup. The u-shapelet discovery algorithm answers this question and proceeds as follows: 
(a) The algorithm takes the length of the pattern as a parameter. (b)
On each time series of the base, a window of the same length as the pattern is dragged, each new sub-sequence obtained by this process is a candidate pattern. (c) The candidate consider as a pattern is the subsequence capable of dividing the time series data set into two subsets $D_a$ and $D_b$ such that $D_a$ contains all the time series which possess the pattern and $D_b$ all those which do not contain the pattern. 


Two other constraints are taken into account in the discovery of patterns: 


\begin{itemize}
\item The first is the ability of the pattern to build subsets that are well separated.
\item The second is the ability of employers to build subsets that are not unbalanced.
\end{itemize}

 That is, the size of $D_a$ must be at most $k$ times larger than that of $D_b$ and vice versa.

\begin{definition}
Two datasets  $D_A$ and $D_B$ are said to be \textbf{r-balanced} if only if \\
$\frac{1}{r}<\frac{|D_{A}|}{|D_{B}|}<(1-\frac{1}{r}),\,r>1$
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
An \textbf{Unsupervised-Shapelet} is any sub-sequence that has a length shorter than or equal to the length of the shortest time series in the dataset, and that allows dividing the dataset into two
\textbf{r-balanced} groups $D_A$ and $D_B$; where $D_A$ is the group of time series that contains a pattern \textbf{similar} to the shapelet and $D_B$ is the group of
time series that does not contain the shapelet.
\end{definition}

The similarity between a time series and a shapelet is evaluated using a distance function.


\begin{definition}
The sub-sequence distance \textbf{sdist(S, T)} between
a time series T and a sub-sequence S is the minimum of the
distances between the sub-sequence S and all possible
sub-sequences of T of length equal to the length of S.
\end{definition}
This definition raises the question of which distance measure to use for $sdist$.
In general, the ubiquitous Euclidean distance (ED) is used, but it is not
appropriate for uncertain time series \cite{Orang2014}. In the following section, we introduce a
dissimilarity function that is more adapted to  uncertainty.   


Computing the $sdist$ between a u-shapelet candidate
and all time series in a dataset creates an orderline:


\begin{definition}
An orderline is a vector of sub-sequence
distances sdist(S, Ti) between a u-shapelet and all time series Ti in the dataset.
\end{definition}

The computation of the orderline is time-consuming. An orderline for a single u-shapelet candidate is $O(NMlog(M))$ where $N$ is the number of time series in the dataset and $M$ is the average length of the time series. The brute force algorithm for U-shapelets discovery requires $K$ such computations, where $K$ is the number of sub-sequences. The strategy used by \cite{ulanova2015scalable} in \textbf{Scalable Unsupervised Shapelet algorithm} consists in filtering the $K$ candidate segments  by considering only those allowing to build r-balanced groups.  This selection is  efficiently made using a hash algorithm.       


The assessment of a u-shapelet quality is based on its separation power which is calculated as follows :
\begin{eqnarray}
gap=\mu_{B}-\sigma_{B}-(\mu_{A}-\sigma_{A}),
\end{eqnarray}


where $\mu_{A}$ (resp. $\mu_{B}$) denotes mean(sdist(S, $D_A$)) (resp. mean(sdist(S, $D_B$))), and
$\sigma_{A}$ (resp. $\sigma_{B}$) represents the standard deviation of $sdist(S,
D_A)$ (resp. standard deviation of $sdist(S, D_B)$).
If $D_A$ or $D_B$ contains only one element (or an insignificant number of elements that cannot represent a separate cluster), the gap score is assigned to zero. This ensures that a  high gap scored for a u-shapelet candidate corresponds to a true separation power.



\subsection{U-shapelets algorithm for clustering Uncertain Time Series }

U-shapelets clustering is a framework introduced by \cite{zakaria2012clustering} who suggested clustering time series from the local properties of their sub-sequences rather than
using their global features  \cite{zhang2016unsupervised}. In that aim, u-shapelets clustering first seeks a set of sub-sequences characteristic of the different categories of time series and classifies a time series according to the presence or absence of these typical sub-sequences in it. 

Clustering time series with u-shapelets has several advantages. Firstly, u-shapelets clustering is defined for datasets in which  time series have different lengths, which is not the case of most techniques described in the literature. Indeed, in many cases, the equal length assumption is implied,
and the trimming to equal length is done by exploiting expensive human skill \cite{ulanova2015scalable}.  Secondly, u-shapelets clustering is much more expressive regarding representational power. Indeed, it allows clustering only time series that can be
clustered and do not cluster those that do not belong to any cluster.

Furthermore, it is very appropriate to use u-shapelets clustering with uncertain time series because it can ignore irrelevant data and thus, reduce the adverse effects of the presence of uncertainties in the time series. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to take into account the adverse impact of uncertainty during u-shapelet discovery.

\subsection{Uncertainty and u-shapelets discovery issue}
Traditional measurement of similarity like Euclidean distance (ED) or Dynamic Time  Warping (DTW) do not always work well for uncertain time series data. Indeed,   they aggregate the uncertainty of each data point of the time series being compared and thus amplify the negative impact of uncertainty. However, ED plays a   fundamental role in u-shapelet discovery because it is used to compute the gap, i.e. the distance between the two groups formed by a u-shapelet candidate. The discovery of u-shapelet on uncertain time series could thus lead to the selection of a wrong u-shapelet candidate or to assign a time series to the wrong cluster.
 
 
 In this study, our goal is not to define an uncertain  u-shapelet algorithm, but rather to use a dissimilarity function robust to uncertainty to improve the quality of the u-shapelets discovered and thus the clustering quality of uncertain time series.

\section[Background]{Background and Related works}

\subsection{Background}

An Uncertain Time Series (UTS) $X=<X_1, \ldots, X_n>$  is a sequence of random
variables where $X_i$  is the random variable modeling the unknown real value
number at timestamp $i$. There are two main ways to model uncertain time series:
multiset-based model and PDF-based model.   

\paragraph{}In \textbf{Multiset-based model}, each element $X_i (1 \leq i \leq n)$ of an UTS $X = <X_1, \ldots,  X_n>$ is represented as a set $\{X_{i,1}, \ldots, X_{i,N_i}\}$ of observed values and $N_i$
  denotes the number of observed values at timestamp $i$ (Fig. \ref{multiset}).

   \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/multiset2}
    \caption{Multiset-based model of uncertain time series.}
  \label{multiset}
  \end{figure}

\paragraph{} In \textbf{PDF-based model}, each element $X_i, (1\leq i \leq n)$ of UTS $X = <X_1, \ldots, X_n>$ is   represented as a random variable $X_i=x_i + X_{e_i}$ (Fig. \ref{pdf}), where $x_i$ is the exact but unknown value  and $X_{e_i}$ is a random variable representing the error. It is this model that we  consider in this work.

Several similarity measures have been proposed for uncertain time series. They are grouped into two main categories: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Traditional similarity measures} such as Euclidean distance are those conventionally used with time series. They use a single uncertain value at each timestamp as an approximation of
  the unknown real value.
  \item \textbf{Uncertain similarity measures} use additional statistical information that quantifies the uncertainty associated with each approximation of the real value : this is the case of
  DUST, PROUD, MUNICH \cite{dallachiesa}.  \cite{Orang2015} demonstrated that the performances of uncertain similarity measures associated with pre-processing of data are higher than those of traditional similarity measurements.
\end{itemize}


   

\subsection{State of the art on uncertain similarity functions}


Uncertain similarity measures  can be grouped into two broad categories : deterministic similarity measurements and probabilistic similarity measurements.

\subsubsection{Deterministic Similarity Measures} 
Like traditional similarity measures, deterministic  similarity measures  return a real number as the distance between two uncertain time series. \textbf{DUST} is an example of deterministic similarity measure.
\\
\textbf{DUST} \cite{murthy2013generalized} Given two uncertain time series \\ $X=<X_1, \ldots,X_n>$ and $Y=<Y_1, \ldots,Y_n>$ , the distance between two uncertain values $X_i$, $Y_i$ is defined as the distance between their true (unknown) values $r(X_i)$, $r(Y_i)$:

\begin{eqnarray}
 dist(X_i, Y_i) = |r(X_i) - r(Y_i)|.
\end{eqnarray}

 This distance is used to measures the similarity of two uncertain values. 

$\varphi(|X_{i}-Y_{i}|)$ is the probability that the real values at timestamp $i$   are equal, given the observed values at that instant :
\begin{eqnarray}
\varphi(|X_{i}-Y_{i}|)=Pr(dist(0, |X_{i}-Y_{i}|)=0).
\end{eqnarray}
This similarity function is then used inside the $dust$ dissimilarity function:
\begin{eqnarray}
dust(X_{i},Y_{i})=\sqrt{-log(\varphi(|X_{i}-Y_{i}|))+log(\varphi(0))}.
\end{eqnarray}
The distance between uncertain time series $X$ and $Y$ in $DUST$
is then defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
DUST(X,Y)=\sqrt{\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}dust(X_{i},Y_{i})^{^{2}}}.
\end{eqnarray} 

During this work, we introduced a deterministic distance for the comparison of uncertain time series. This distance has useful properties but gives only average results when used for a classification task(Appendix \ref{helinger}). The problem with the deterministic uncertain distances like $DUST$ is that their expression varies as a function of the probability distribution of uncertainty,  and the probability distribution of the uncertainty is not always available in time series datasets.


\subsubsection{Probabilistic Similarity Measures}
Probabilistic similarities measures do not require knowledge of the uncertainty probability distribution. Furthermore, they provide the users with more information about the reliability of the result. There are several probabilistic similarity functions, as MUNICH, PROUD, PROUDS or Local Correlation. 
\\
\textbf{MUNICH} \cite{assfalg2009probabilistic}:
This distance function is suitable for uncertain time series represented by the multiset based model. The probability that the distance between two uncertain time series $X$ and $Y$ is less than a threshold $\varepsilon$ is equal to the number of distances between $X$ and $Y$, which are less than $\varepsilon$, over the possible number of distances:

\begin{eqnarray}
Pr(distance(X,Y))\leq\varepsilon=\frac{|\{d\in
dists(X,Y)|d\leq\varepsilon\}|}{|dists(X,Y)|}.
\end{eqnarray}

The computation of this distance function is very time-consuming.
\\
\textbf{PROUD} \cite{yeh2009proud} Let $X$ and $Y$ be two UTS each one modeled  by a sequence of random variables, the PROUD distance between $X$ and $Y$ is $d(X,Y)=\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}(X_{i}-Y_{i})^{2}.$
According to the central limit theorem \cite{hoffmann1976law}, the cumulative distribution of the distances approaches asymptotically a normal distribution:

\begin{eqnarray}
d(X,Y)\propto
N(\underset{i}{\sum}E[(X_{i}-Y_{i})^{2}],\underset{i}{\sum}Var[(X_{i}-Y_{i})^{2}]).
\end{eqnarray}

As a consequence of that feature of PROUD distance,  the table of the normal centered reduced law can be used to compute the probability that the normalized distance is lower than a threshold:
\begin{eqnarray}
Pr(d(X,Y)_{norm}\leq\epsilon).
\end{eqnarray} 

A major disadvantage of PROUD is its inadequacy for comparing time series of small lengths like u-shapelets. Indeed, the calculation of the probability that the PROUD distance is less than a value is based on the assumption that PROUD distance follows \textbf{asymptotically} a normal distribution.  Thus, this probability will be all the more accurate as the compared time series are long (i.e. contain more than 30 data points).

\\
\textbf{PROUDS}\cite{Orang2015} is an enhanced version of PROUD, which suppose that random variables coming from time series are independent and
identically distributed. 


\begin{definition}
\label{normal}
The normal form of a standard time series $X = <X_1, \ldots, X_n>$ is defined as
$\hat{X}=<\hat{X_{1}},\ldots,\hat{X_{n}}>$ in which for each timestamp i $(1 \leq i \leq n)$, we have:

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{X_{i}}=\frac{X_{i}-\bar{X}}{S_{X}},\:\bar{X}=\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}\frac{X_{i}}{n},\:S_{X}=\sqrt{\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}\frac{(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{^{2}}}{(n-1)}}.
\end{eqnarray}
\label{normal2}
\end{definition}



PROUDS defines the distance between two normalized time series  $\hat{X}=<\hat{X}_{1}...\hat{X}_{n}>$ and $\hat{Y}=<\hat{Y}_{1}...\hat{Y}_{n}>$ (Definition \ref{normal2}) as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
Eucl(\hat{X},\hat{Y})=2(n-1)+2\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}\hat{X}_{i}\hat{Y}_{i}.
\end{eqnarray}

For the same reasons as PROUD, PROUDS is not suitable for the comparison of short time series. Another disadvantage of PROUDS is that it assumes that the random variables  are independent: this hypothesis is strong and particularly inappropriate for short time series like u-shapelets. A more realistic hypothesis with time series would be to consider that the random variables constituting the time series are $M$-dependent. Random variables of a time series are called $M$-dependent
 if $X_{i},X_{i+1},...,X_{i+M}$ are dependent (correlated) and the
variables $X_{i}$ and $X_{i+M+1}$ are independent. However, the $M$-dependent assumption could make PROUDS writing more complex and its use more difficult because of the choice of the parameter $M$. 

\\
\textbf{Uncertain Correlation} \cite{Orang2017}: 
Correlation analysis techniques are useful for feature selection in uncertain time series data. Indeed, correlation indicates the degree of dependency of a feature on other features. Using this information, redundant features can be identified. The same strategy can be useful for  u-shapelet discovery.  Uncertain
correlation is defined as follows : 


\begin{definition}
(Uncertain time series correlation) Given UTS  $X = <X_1, \ldots, X_n>$ and  $Y = <Y_1, \ldots, Y_n>$, their correlation is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
Corr(X,Y)=\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}\hat{X_{i}}\hat{Y_{i}}/(n-1),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\hat{X_{i}}$ and
$\hat{Y_{i}}$ are normal forms of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ (Definition \ref{normal2}), respectively. $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are supposed to be independant continous random variables.
\end{definition}
If we know the probability distribution of random variables, it is possible to determine the probability density function associated with the correlation, which will subsequently be used to calculate the probability that the correlation between two time series is greater than a given threshold.   


Uncertain correlation has however some drawbacks :
\begin{itemize}
\item It is too sensitive to transient changes, often leading to widely fluctuating scores;
\item It cannot capture complex relationship in timeseries;
\item It requires to know the probability distribution function of the uncertainty or to make some assumption on the independence of the random variables  contained in time series.

\end{itemize}
Because of all theses drawbacks, uncertain correlation cannot be used as it is for u-shapelet discovery. The next paragraph presents a generalisation of correlation coefficient that is not an uncertain similarity function but is still interesting for u-shapelet discovery.
\textbf{Local Correlation} \cite{papadimitriou2006local} is a
generalization of the correlation. It computes a time-evolving correlation scores that tracks a local similarity on multivariate time series based on local autocorrelation matrix. The autocorrelation matrix \textbf{allows capturing complex relationship} in time series like the key oscillatory (e.g., sinusoidal) as well as aperiodic trends (e.g., increasing or decreasing)  that are present. The use of  autocorrelation
matrices which are computed based on overlapping windows allows \textbf{reducing the sensibility to transient changes} in time series.


\begin{definition}
(Local autocovariance, sliding window). Given a time series $X$, a sample set of windows with length w, the local autocorrelation matrix estimator $\hat{\Gamma}_{t}$ using a sliding window is defined at time $t \in \mathbb{N} $ as (Eq.\ref{autoCor}) : 

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\varGamma}_{t}(X,w,m)=\stackrel[\tau=t-m+1]{t}{\sum}x_{\tau,w}\otimes x_{\tau,w}.
\label{autoCor}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\boldsymbol{x}_{\tau,\omega}$ is a sub-sequence of the time series of length $w$ and started at $\tau$, $x \otimes y = xy^T$ is the outer product of x and y. The sample set of m windows is centered around time t.
 The number of windows is  typically fixed to m = w.
\end{definition}

Given the estimates $\hat{\Gamma}_{t}(X)$ and $\hat{\Gamma}_{t}(Y)$ for the two time series, the next step is how to compare them and extract a correlation score. This goal is reached using the spectral decomposition. The eigenvectors of the autocorrelation matrices capture the key aperiodic and oscillatory trends, even \textbf{in short time series}.  Thus, the subspaces spanned by the first few ($k$) eigenvectors are used  to locally characterize the behavior of each series. Definition \ref{score} formalizes this notion: 


\begin{definition}
\label{score}
(LoCo score). Given two series $X$ and $Y$, their LoCo score is defined by

\begin{eqnarray}
\ell_{t}(X,Y)=\frac{1}{2}(\Vert
\boldsymbol{U}_{X}^{T}\boldsymbol{u}_{Y}\Vert+\Vert
\boldsymbol{U}_{Y}^{T}\boldsymbol{u}_{X}\Vert)
\end{eqnarray}

\end{definition}    


where $\boldsymbol{U}_X$ and  $\boldsymbol{U}_Y$ are the $k$ first eigenvector
matrices of the local autocorrelation $\hat{\Gamma}_{t}(X)$ and
$\hat{\Gamma}_{t}(Y)$ respectively, and $u_X$  and $u_Y$  are the
corresponding eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue. 


Intuitively, two time series $X$ and $Y$ will be considered as close when the angle
$\alpha$ formed by the space carrying the information of the time series $X$ and
the vector carrying the information the time series $Y$ is zero. In other words $X$
and $Y$ will be close when the value of  $cos(\alpha)$ will be 1 (Fig. \ref{geoLoco}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.70]{images/loco2}
\caption{Geometric representation of LoCo similarity.}
\label{geoLoco}
\end{figure}



The only assumption made for the computation of LoCo similarity is that the mean of time
series data point is zero. This could be easily achieved with z-normalization.
LoCo similarity function has many interesting properties and does not require to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Know the probability distribution of the uncertainty,
  \item Assume the independence of the random variables or the length of
  u-shapelets.
\end{itemize}

LoCo is therefore interesting for feature selection, but we still need a dissimilarity
function to be able to discover u-shapelet. In the next paragraph, we 
define a dissimilarity function that has the same properties as LoCo and that is
robust to the presence of uncertainty.





\section{Frobenius cOrrelation for uncertain Time series u-Shapelet discovery (FOTS)}
\subsection{Dissimilarity function}

The LoCo similarity function defined on two multivariate time series $X$ and $Y$ approximately corresponds  to the absolute value of the cosine of the angle formed by the eigenspaces of $X$ and $Y$ ($|cos(\alpha)|$). A straightforward idea would be to use the $sin(\alpha)$ or $\alpha$-value as a dissimilarity function but this approach does not work so well, because the sine and the angle are not discriminant enough for eigenvector comparison for clustering purpose. We thus proposed a new dissimilarity measure named Frobenius cOrrelation for uncertain Time series u-Shapeletdiscovery (FOTS) and based on the following definition (Definition. \ref{FOTS}): 


\begin{definition}
\label{FOTS}
 Given two series $X$
and $Y$, their FOTS score is defined by
\begin{eqnarray}
FOTS(X,Y)=\Vert U_{X}-U_{Y}\Vert_{F}
=\sqrt{\stackrel[i=1]{m}{\sum}\stackrel[j=1]{k}{\sum}(U_{X}-U_{Y})_{ij}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Vert\Vert_{F}$ is the Frobenius norm, $m$ is the length of time series and $k$ is the number of eigenvectors.
\end{definition}
 
 Because  FOTS computation is based on the comparison of the $k$-first eigenvectors of the autocorrelation
 matrices of the time series, it has the same desirable properties of the LoCo
 similarity function, that is: 
 
 \begin{itemize}
   \item It \textbf{allows to capture complex relationships}
in time series like the key oscillatory (e.g., sinusoidal) as well as aperiodic (e.g.,
increasing or decreasing) trends that are present;
   \item It allows to \textbf{reduce the sensibility to transient changes} in time
   series;
   \item It is appropriate for the \textbf{comparison of short
   time series}.
 \end{itemize}

  Moreover, the FOTS dissimilarity function is \textbf{robust to the presence of
  uncertainty} due to the spectral decomposition of the autocorrelation matrices of the time series. The robustness of FOTS to  uncertainty is confirmed by the  theorem of HoffmanWielandt:   

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{(Hoffman\-Wielandt)} \cite{Bhatia1993} If $X$ and $X + E$ are $n \times
n$ symmetric matrices, then : 
\begin{eqnarray}
\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}(\lambda_{i}(X+E)-\lambda_{i}(X))^{2}\leq||E||_{F}^{2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lambda_i(X)$ is the ith largest eigenvalue of $X$, and $||E||_{F}^{2}$
is the squared of the Frobenius norm of E.
\end{theorem}

The next section explains how FOTS is integrated in the Scalable Unsupervised Shapelet discovery algorithm \cite{ulanova2015scalable}.


\subsection{Scalable u-shapelets Algorithm with FOTS score}
In this section we do not define a new SUShapelet algorithm \cite{ulanova2015scalable}, but we explain how we use SUShapelet algorithm with FOTS score (FOTS-SUSh) to deal with uncertainty.



The $gap$ is an essential criterion for the selection of u-shapelets candidate. It is subject to uncertainty because its calculation is based on the
Euclidean distance. To remedy this, we propose to use the FOTS score instead of
a simple Euclidean distance when calculating the $gap$ in the Scalable u-shapelet algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithm  \ref{algo1} presents how we compute the orderline using FOTS score,
\item Algorithm \ref{algo2} calculates the orderline and sorts the time series according to their proximity to the u-shapelet candidate (line 2 and 3). A u-shapelet is considered present in a time series if its distance to it is less than or equal to a given threshold. Thus, algorithm select thresholds to build a cluster $Da$ whose size varies between $lb$ and $ub$ (line 5).  The algorithm then searches among the selected thresholds the one that has a maximum $gap$ (line 6 to 11).
\end{itemize}

  
  

 \begin{definition}
The sub-sequence FOTS dissimilarity $\boldsymbol{sd_f(S, T)}$ between
a time series T and a sub-sequence S is the minimum  FOTS
score between the sub-sequence S and all possible
sub-sequences of T of length equal to the length of S.

\section[Experiments]{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Clustering with u-shapelets}
There are many ways to cluster time series data described by u-shapelets. This approach is a direct implementation of the u-shapelet definition. The algorithm iteratively splits the dataset with each discovered u-shapelet into two groups $D_A$ and $D_B$. The time series that belong to $D_A$ are considered as members of the cluster formed by the u-shapelet and are then removed from the dataset. A new u-shapelet search continues with the rest of the data until there is no more time series in the dataset or until the algorithm is no more able to find u-shapelet. As a stopping criterion for the number of u-shapelets extracted, the decline of the u-shapelet gap score is examined: the algorithm stops when the gap score of the newly-found u-shapelet becomes less than half of the gap score of the first discovered u- shapelet. 
\\
\textbf{Choosing the length $N$ of a u-shapelet: }
The choice of the length of u-shapelet is directed by the knowledge of the
domain to which the time series belongs. As part of these experiments, we tested all  numbers between 4 and half the length of the time series. We considered as length of u-shapelet the one that allows to better cluster the time series.
\\
\textbf{Choosing the length $w$ of the windows : }
The use of overlapping windows for calculating the autocorrelation matrix makes
it possible to capture the oscillations present in the time series. During these experiments, we considered that the size of the window is equal to half the length of the u-shapelet.
\\
\textbf{Choosing  the number $k$ of eigenvectors: }
A practical choice is to fix $k$ to a small value; we used $k = 4$ throughout all
experiments. Indeed, key aperiodic trends are captured by one eigenvector,
whereas key oscillatory trends manifest themselves in a pair of eigenvectors.  

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To evaluate the quality of the u-shapelets found, we use them for a clustering task. Different measures for time series clustering quality have been proposed, including Jaccard Score, Rand Index, Folkes and Mallow index, etc. In our case we had ground truth class labels for the datasets, we could use this external information to evaluate the true clustering quality by using Rand Index. Moreover, Rand Index appears to be the quality measure  most commonly used   \cite{zakaria2012clustering} \cite{ulanova2015scalable} \cite{zhang2016unsupervised}, and many of the other measures can be seen as minor variants of it \cite{halkidi2001clustering}.
The Rand Index \cite{rand1971objective} is calculated as follows:
\\
Let $Lc$ be the cluster labels returned by a clustering algorithm and Lt be the
set of ground truth class labels. Let $A$ be the number of time series that are
placed in the same cluster in $L_c$ and $L_t$, $B$ be the number of time series in
different clusters in $L_c$ and $L_t$, $C$ be the number of time series in the same
cluster in Lc but not in $L_t$ and $D$ be the number of time series in different
clusters in $L_c$ but in same cluster in $L_t$. The Rand Index is computed as follows:  

\begin{eqnarray}
Rand\,Index = (A+B)/(A+B+C+D).
\end{eqnarray}    

\subsection{Comparison with u-shapelet}
Similarly to \cite{dallachiesa}, we tested FOTS-SUSh on 17 real world datasets coming from UCR archive \cite{UCRArchive} and representing a wide range of application domains. The training and testing sets have been joined to obtained bigger datasets. Table \ref{datasets} present detailed information about tested datasets.

\subsection{Comparison with k-Shape and USLM}

k-Shape and USLM are two u-shapelets  based clustering algorithms for time series presented in \cite{zhang2016unsupervised}. In this section, we have compared the Rand Index obtained by FOTS-SUShapelet and the one obtained by k-Shape and USLM on 5 datasets (Table \ref{comparison_rand_index}). The results of k-Shape and USLM was previously reported in \cite{zhang2016unsupervised}. This comparison shows that in general, FOTS-SUShapelet perform better than k-Shape and USLM.

\subsection{Discussion}

The use of the FOTS score associated with the SUShapelet algorithm allows to discover different u-shapelets than those found by the Euclidean
distance. The FOTS-SUSh improves the results of time series clustering because the FOTS score takes into account the intrinsic properties of the time series when searching for u-shapelets and is robust to the presence of uncertainty. This improvement is particularly significant when the FOTS score is used for the clustering of time series containing several small oscillations. Indeed, these oscillations are not captured by the Euclidean distance whereas they are by the FOTS score whose calculation is based on the autocorrelation matrix. This observation is illustrated by the result obtained on the SwedishLeaf dataset.

\subsubsection{Time complexity analysis} ED can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ and  FOTS score is computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^\omega),\:2\leq\omega\leq3$ due to the time complexity of the eigenvector decompositions \cite{pan1999complexity}. The computation of FOTS score is then more expensive in time than that of ED (Fig. \ref{timecomparison}). However, its use remains relevant for u-shapelets research as they are often small.

\section[Conclusion]{Conclusion and Future Work}
The purpose of this chapter was to discover u-shapelets on uncertain time series. In that aim, we have proposed a dissimilarity score (FOTS) adapted to the comparison of short time series, of which computation is based on the comparison of the eigenvector of the autocorrelation matrices of the time series. This score is robust to the presence of uncertainty, it is not very sensitive to transient changes, and it allows capturing complex relationships between time series such as oscillations and trends. The FOTS score was used with the Scalable Unsupervised Shapelet Discovery algorithm for clustering 17 literature datasets and it has shown  an improvement in the quality of clustering evaluated using the Rand Index.  By combining the benefits of the u-shapelets algorithm, which reduces the adverse effects of uncertainty, and the benefits of the FOTS score, which is robust to the presence of uncertainty, chapter has defined a framework for clustering uncertain time series. As a perspective to this work, we plan to use the FOTS score for fuzzy clustering of uncertain time series. Another important aspect of time series coming from wheelchair locomotion is that they are cyclic, and the analysis of this movement is based on those cycles. The next chapter explains how we have captured this important feature.
