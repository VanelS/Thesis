\chapter{An optimal approach for time series segmentation: Application to the supervised classification}
\label{seg}

\section{Introduction}
Time series databases are often huge. This is particularly the case of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) database which records data from of telescopes \cite {lsst}. It has billions of time series (10 Petabytes). The time series recorded in these databases are sometimes very long. Another example is the  SACR-FRM project that uses sensors to measure the efforts of a  manual wheelchair user at a frequency of 100 Hz \cite{SACR-FRM}. Ten minutes recording time series of 60 000 measurements. Faced with this, several scientific works were carried out with the aim of reducing the storage space of time series and accelerating their treatment.  A widely used approach is to change the representation of time series to reduce their length. This technique was introduced by Agrawal et al. \cite{Agrawal1993}; he uses the discrete Fourier transform to obtain a compact representation of the time series.
 Other methods have also been used: the decomposition in eigenvalue \cite{Wu1996}, the  discrete wavelet transform \cite{Chan1999} and the piecewise approximate aggregation (PAA) \cite{keogh2001locally}. This last method has shown its effectiveness compared to previous three because it is easier to understand, to implement, but also faster and allows to build indexes in linear time. PAA suggests splitting the time series into segments of the same length, then replace each segment by the average of its points. This method generates a compact representation, able to have a few segments as possible to reduce space storage and processing time of time series.
 However, a too compact representation distorts the time series and causes a loss of information. How then to choose the right number of segments to consider? Our work is based on a simple observation: the use of the arithmetic average is relevant when the variance of the population is small as illustrated by the figure \ref{fig:average}.

\caption{These figures show the average of two segments. In the first
case (a) the data points of the segment are far from the average, in the second case (b) they are close to the average. Replace data points of a segment by their average introduces an error that the can be measured from the gap between the points and the average. }

\label{fig:average}
\end{figure}


 
 
 We define here a minimal bound for the number of segments to be considered, and we propose an algorithm which allows choosing the number of segments which minimizes their mean squared error, with the aim to reduce the length of the time series without altering the information they contain.
 
 
  The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: the \ref{problem} section presents a formal definition of our problem and an algorithm used to solve it; the section \ref{results} presents and comments the results of the experiments and the section \ref{conclusion} concludes the paper and presents perspectives for this work.
 

\section{Granularity of time series segments}
\label{probleme}


\subsection{Notations and definitions}
\paragraph{Definition 1:} A \textbf{time series} or \textbf{time series}
$ X = x_{0}, x_{1}, \cdots, x_{m} $ is a sequence of numerical values representing the evolution of a specific quantity over time. $ x_{m} $ is the most recent value.

\paragraph{Definition 2:} A segment $ X_{i} $ of length $ l $ of the time series
$ X $ of size $ m $ $ (l <m) $ is a sequence consisting of $ l $ consecutive variables
$ X $ beginning at the  position  $ i $  and ending at the position $ i + l-1 $.
We have: $ X_{i} = x_{i}, x_{i + 1}, ..., x_{i + l-1} $

\paragraph{Definition 3:} The arithmetic mean of the data points of a segment $ X_{i} $ of size $ l $ is
denoted $ \bar {X}_{i} $ and is defined by
\[
\bar{X}_{i} = \frac{1}{l} \sum_{j = 0}^{l-1} x_{i + j}.
\]



\subsection{Information theory and minimum number of segments}
To mitigate the effects of noise during time series processing, Keogh and Kasetty \cite{KeoghBenchmarks} recommend that they are normalized. Normalizing the time series makes them compatible with a normal distribution \cite{Lin2007}. In this case, 95 \% of the points in the time series are between minus two times the standard deviation $ (\sigma) $ and twice the standard deviation of the points, and thus 5 \% of the points of the series are outside this range. These points correspond to the ends of the series as shown in the figure \ref{standard_deviation}.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.50]{fordA_ecart-type}
\caption{This figure shows the first 100 points of the first time series  of the fordA dataset available in the UCR \cite{UCRArchive} database. Time series are normalized. The two horizontal lines delimit the interval corresponding to twice the standard deviation and minus two times the standard deviation of the points of the time series. We can observe that the points outside this range are at the ends of the time series.}
\label{standard_deviation} 
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Definition 1:} A \textbf{time series} or \textbf{time series}
$ X = x_{0}, x_{1}, \cdots, x_{m} $ is a sequence of numerical values representing the evolution of a specific quantity over time. $ x_{m} $ is the most recent value.

\paragraph{Definition 2:} A segment $ X_{i} $ of length $ l $ of the time series
$ X $ of size $ m $ $ (l <m) $ is a sequence consisting of $ l $ consecutive variables
$ X $ beginning at the  position  $ i $  and ending at the position $ i + l-1 $.
We have: $ X_{i} = x_{i}, x_{i + 1}, ..., x_{i + l-1} $

\paragraph{Definition 3:} The arithmetic mean of the data points of a segment $ X_{i} $ of size $ l $ is
denoted $ \bar {X}_{i} $ and is defined by
\[
\bar{X}_{i} = \frac{1}{l} \sum_{j = 0}^{l-1} x_{i + j}.
\]




Also, information theory tells us that the amount of information relating to an event is equal to $ -log_{2}(p) $ where $ p $ is the probability of the event
\cite{Shannon2001} . In other words, a very likely event ($ p \longrightarrow1 $) brings less information than an unlikely event ($ p \longrightarrow0 $). Therefore, a point outside the interval $ [- 2 \sigma, 2 \sigma] $ provides more information than a point in that range. Indeed, the probability that one point is in the range is $ 0.95$ while the probability that one point is out of range is $ 0.05 = \frac{1}{20} $ .


If we choose a minimum number $ (\alpha) $ of segments less than 5 \% of the length of the time series, we risk to aggregate the data points within the interval $ [- 2 \sigma, 2 \sigma] $ and those outside this range. This will have two consequences: firstly, this aggregation will alter the information carried by data points. Secondly, this aggregation will increase the variance of the segments obtained. So we chose to  consider 5\% of the number of points in the time series as the minimum number of segments. This allows us to define the following functions of $ \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} $:

\[
\alpha: n \mapsto \alpha(n) = \left \{
\begin{array}{c}
\left \lfloor \frac{n}{20} \right \rfloor \: if \: \left \lfloor \frac{n}{20} \right \rfloor \geq 2 \\
2 \: otherwise
\end{array} 
\right.
\]



\[
\beta: n \mapsto \beta(n) = \left \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor
\]
 $ \beta $ gives the maximum number of segments. Indeed, a segment is made up of at least 2 points, so there is at most $ \left \lfloor
\frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor $ segments. The number of segments W that we will consider is greater than or equal to $ \alpha (| X |) $ and less than or equal to $ \beta (| X |) $. The next subsection explains how we choose the value of W.

\subsection{Minimize the squared error to choose the number of segments}
After dividing into segments, we replace each segment by the average of the data points that constitute it. The variance between the points of each segment can be measured from the mean squared error. Our problem is therefore the following:
\paragraph{} Let $ X = x_{0}, x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n} $ a time series of size $ n $, look for $ W \in \mathbb{N} $ such that $ \alpha(n) \leq W \leq \beta(n) $ and $ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{^{W}} \sum_{j = (i-1) k}^{ik} (\bar{X}_{i} - X_{j})^{2} $ is minimal. Where $ \bar{X}_{i} $ is the arithmetic mean of a segment of length $ k $. 




\paragraph{} To solve this problem, we
propose an algorithm that proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each value of W, with $ \alpha(n) \leq W \leq \beta(n) $
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the squared error of each segment
$ X_{i} = x_{i}, x_{i + 1}, ..., x_{i + l-1}; $
\item Calculate the mean of the quadratic errors;
\end{enumerate}
\item The value of W returned is the one that produces a minimum average squared error; 
\end{enumerate}

Algorithm \ref{algo1} details the previous principle.

\paragraph{Complexity of the algorithm}
The calculation of the squared error of a segment is done in $ O(\left \lfloor
\frac{n}{W} \right \rfloor) $.

The time complexity of calculating the mean squared error for segment splitting is
$ O(n). $


The number of segments varies from $ \left \lfloor \frac{n}{20} \right \rfloor, \; \left \lfloor \frac{n}{19} \right \rfloor $ \ldots $ \left \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor $. There are 19 possible divisions in segments. The time complexity of calculating the value of W which minimizes the error
mean squared is $ 19 \times O(n) = O(n) $.


To exploit the compact representations of the time series, we must be able to compare them. The next subsection presents how to compare compact time series that we get.

\subsection{Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm and comparison of compact representations}

The dynamic time warping algorithm \cite{Keogh2004} allows to carry out a non-linear correspondence between two time series by minimizing the distance between the two. It proceeds as follows:
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two time series;

\[
X=x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{n};
\]


\[
Y=y_{1},y_{2},\cdots,y_{m}.
\]

 To align them, the algorithm constructs a matrix $ n \times m $ where
the element $ (i, j) $ of the matrix corresponds to the square distance $ (x_{i} - y_{j}) ^ {2} $ which
is the alignment between $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{j} $. To find the best alignment between the two time series, we build
the path in the matrix that minimizes the sum of the square distances. This path is calculated by
dynamic programming from the following recurrence:
\[
\gamma(i, j) = d (x_{i}, y_{j}) + min \{\gamma(i-1, j-1), \gamma(i-1, j), \gamma(i , j-1) \},
\]
where $ d(x_{i}, y_{j}) $ is the square of the distance contained in the cell $ (i, j) $ and $ \gamma(i, j) $ is the
cumulative distance at the position $ (i, j) $ which is calculated by the sum of the square of the distance to
the position $ (i, j) $ and the minimum cumulative distance of its three adjacent cells.


Piecewise aggregate approximation provides Euclidean-based distance measurement to compare compact representations. However, we chose to use the dynamic time warping algorithm. For the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The dynamic time warping algorithm  is known to have the best performance for sequence alignment in several areas:
in robotics, biometrics, music, climatology, aviation, in gesture recognition, cryptanalysis, astronomy, exploration
space \cite{Rakthanmanon2012}.
\item Piecewise aggregate approximation of the time series leads to temporal deformation. Indeed,
with two time series of length $ n $, we can apply our algorithm to the
 first time series, then reduce it to $ N_{1} $ segments and reduce the second to $ N_{2} $
 segments with $ N_{1} <N_{2} $.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{results} 
 First, we present the datasets used during the experiment.
 Then we evaluate the performances of the proposed methods in terms of  reduction of the
 length of time series and classification errors.

\subsection{Datasets}

We performed tests on 85 datasets that come from the UCR database
\cite{UCRArchive} . Detailed information on the datasets is presented in
the table \ref{sets_of_data}.
 In the UCR database, each data set is divided into a learning set and a test set. Datasets contain between 2 and 60 classes and the time series of these datasets have lengths that range from 24 to 2709 points. The table \ref{sets_of_data} presents a
 detailed description of the datasets. The following paragraph presents the assessment of the performance of our algorithm on these datasets.

\subsection{Comparison of algorithm performance}
% Visionner le code LaTeX du paragraphe 21
The table \ref{erreur_classification} presents the comparison
of the classification error of 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) algorithms associated with Euclidean  distance (4), 1-NN, associated with the dynamic time warping algorithm using a constraint (a deformation window) (5), 1-NN associated with the algorithm of unconstrained dynamic time warping (DTW) applied to the raw data (6) and the 1-NN algorithm associated with DTW applied to the data pre-processed by our algorithm  (7). The $ (4) $ algorithm gives the best results that are to say
$ ((4) \leq (5) \: and \:(4) \leq (6) \: and \:(4) \leq (7)) $ on $ 20 $ datasets, the algorithm $ (5) $ is the best on $ 47 $ datasets, the $ (6) $ algorithm is the best on $ 21 $ datasets, the $ (7) $ algorithm is the best on $ 21 $ datasets. Although no of these algorithms have the best performance on all datasets, the algorithm $ (5) $ averaged the smallest misclassification \textbf{0.237} and the most expensive $ (4) $ algorithm large average error \textbf{0,288}.
The $ (6) $ and $ (7) $ algorithms have relatively close average error rates  equal to \textbf{0,256} and \textbf{0,258} respectively.


To evaluate the effects of the \textbf{change of representation} of the time series on their
\textbf{classification}, we compare the length of the time series and the errors of
classification presented by the columns $ (6) $ and $ (7) $ of the table  \ref{erreur_classification}.
Indeed, these two columns use the same 1-NN classification algorithm and the same function
distance DTW. The only difference between these columns is the nature of the data; the $ (6) $ column
uses the raw data and the column $ (7) $ the compacted data with the method described above.

\begin{itemize}
\item Regarding the length of the time series; the $ (6) $ algorithm uses all the points of
the time series. On the other hand, the $ (7) $ algorithm uses compact representations whose
length varies between \textbf{15} \% and \textbf{34} \% of the initial length of the time series.
On average, the compact representations have a length equal to \textbf {20} \% of the initial time series
\item For classification errors, the error $ (7)> (6) $ on 40 datasets,
the error of $ (7) = (6) $ on 3 datasets and the error of $ (7) <(6) $ on 42 datasets.
\end {itemize}

 These results are encouraging because despite the reduction in the length of the time series
 errors, the classification error with the compact representation is less than or equal to
that of the raw data classification for 45 datasets out of the 85 available in the
UCR base. These results are summarized in Figure \ref{synthesis}. One of the reasons for this observed improvement over 42 datasets is as follows: the dynamic time warping algorithm  is sensitive to noise, therefore by aggregating the points of the segments, we reduce the effects of noise.

\section{Conclusion}

The purpose of this article was to propose an algorithm for choosing the number of segments to consider for the compact representation of a time series. For this, we have defined a minimum bound for the number of segments to be considered which is equal to 5 \% of the length of the time series. We have proposed an algorithm that chooses the number W of segments minimizing the mean squared error. Results of experiments conducted on 42 datasets
 have shown that the number of segments chosen allows two improvements
 \begin{itemize}
\item significantly reduce the length of the series
temporal; time series of reduced size has a length
which varies between $ 15 \% $ and $ 34 \% $ of the initial time series length
\item improves supervised classification results on a set of 85 datasets
used in the literature. 
\end{itemize}
As a perspective for this work, we plan to vary the number of
segments W from $ 2 $ to $ \frac{n}{2} $ to see if our value of W is optimum for a task classification. We also plan to compare the results of this compact representation to
those of other representations of literature. We also plan to parallelize our algorithm to calculate the right number of segments in linear time (almost trivial). This work allows
reducing the storage space and the processing time of the time series. It also allows choosing the number of segments to consider when designing representations
symbolic of time series. Indeed, several symbolic representations of series
of the literature (SAX \cite{lin2003symbolic}, ESAX \cite{lkhagva2006extended}, 1d-SAX \cite{Malinowski2013},
SAX-TD \cite{sun2014improvement}, SAX-P \cite{siyou2015}) use the division into segments recommended by PAA.

\label{fig:average}
\end{figure}

The empirical probability density function does not allow us a priori to know which probability law follows the residuals (uncertainty). To determine this, we will use statistical tests. The principle of statistical tests is as follow: we assume that the residues follow a defined probability law. And we calculate a p-value. If it is less than 0.05, the above hypothesis is rejected. Another method to determine the probability law follows by the residuals is to hypothesize that data followed a particular law and estimated the parameters that best feet the law. If the theoretical probability density function estimated is closed to the empirical one, we assume that we find the probability law follows by residuals.


\section{Theoric probability distribution}

Residuals are real values between minus infinity and plus infinity. The probability laws that residuals can follow are therefore

\begin{itemize}
\item A normal law
\item A law of cauchy
\item A Student's Law t
\item A general exponential law
\item A double exponential law
\item Generalized error distribution (GED)
\item A pearson law type 4
\item A generalization of the student's law.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Normality test}:
For each tests in (table \ref{normal}), the p-value is significant, so the sample does not follow a normal distribution.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{normality test show that residues(uncertainty) do not follow normal law}
\label{normal}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\textbf{Test}    & Kolmogorov-Smirnov & Anderson-Darling  & Shapiro-Wilk      \\
\textbf{p-value} & \textless 2.2e-16  & \textless 2.2e-16 & \textless 2.2e-16
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Cauchy's Law Test}: The qqplot line does not match correctly with the data particularly the two extremities of the diagram (Fig. \ref{cauchy}); we can say that the data probably do not follow a Cauchy law.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{cauchy}
\caption{Estimated probability density of data for cauchy's law}
\label{cauchy}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Student's Law test}: The Quantile-Quantile diagram, from the distribution function, doesn't match correctly the data, particularly the two extremities of the diagram (Fig. \ref{student}). We can then say that the data do not follow a Student law.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Estimated probability density of data for Student's law}
\label{student}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Logistics law} The probability density function matches the data reasonably well(Fig. \ref{logistic}), so we can say that the \textbf{residuals (uncertainty) following a zero-inflated logistic law}.

\chapter{Training and changes on propulsion technics}
\label{training_technic}
In this section, we want to evaluate the effect of the experiment on the propulsion technique used by manual wheelchair users. We assume that the shape of the Z moment of the left and right wheels reflects the propulsion technique used. Thus, in this paragraph, rather than using an approach that uses cycle properties, we will directly compare time series from a distance function while taking into account the presence of uncertainty in measurements. To do this, we applied FOTS-UShapelet to the measurements made and we deliver here the analysis we make of the results obtained.



FOTS-UShapelet was applied to the time series from the measurement of efforts made by 08 valid subjects during the first week of use and after three weeks of use of the Manual Wheelchair. The table\ref{technic} details the results we get. From the shape of the time series, we can form three large groups that correspond to three techniques that we have named T1, T2 and T3. For each subject of the experiment, we observe a difference between the propulsion techniques used at the beginning of the trial period and after three weeks. The subject SA01 for example uses the T1 technique 83\% and the T3 technique 17\% of the time during the first week. However, after three weeks of using the Manual Wheelchair, he uses the T1 technique 33\% of the time and the T3 technique 67\% of the time. So there is a change in the way he moves. 
However, the changes observed vary according to the subjects (Table \ref{technic}). The variations in the evolution of propulsion techniques require personalized monitoring of locomotion and highlights the importance of using a Wheelchair Ergometer when learning locomotion in a Manual Wheelchair.
