DTW in combination with one-nearest neighbor, one of the simplest machine learning methods, has been difficult to convincingly outperform on the time series classification task. In this paper, we present a simple technique for time series classification that exploits DTW's strength on this task. But instead of directly using DTW as a distance measure to find nearest neighbors, the technique uses DTW to create new features which are then given to a standard machine learning method. We experimentally show that our technique improves over one-nearest neighbor DTW on 31 out of 47 UCR time series benchmark datasets. In addition, this method can be easily extended to be used in combination with other methods. In particular, we show that when combined with the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) method, it improves over it on 37 out of 47 UCR datasets. Thus the proposed method also provides a mechanism to combine distance-based methods like DTW with feature-based methods like SAX. We also show that combining the proposed classifiers through ensembles further improves the performance on time series classification.},

  abstract     = {Paleoclimate time series are often irregularly sampled and age uncertain, which is an important technical challenge to overcome for successful reconstruction of past climate variability and dynamics. Visual comparison and interpolation-based linear correlation approaches have been used to infer dependencies from such proxy time series. While the first is subjective, not measurable and not suitable for the comparison of many data sets at a time, the latter introduces interpolation bias, and both face difficulties if the underlying dependencies are nonlinear.$\backslash$n In this paper we investigate similarity estimators that could be suitable for the quantitative investigation of dependencies in irregular and age-uncertain time series. We compare the Gaussian-kernel-based cross-correlation (gXCF, Rehfeld et al., 2011) and mutual information (gMI, Rehfeld et al., 2013) against their interpolation-based counterparts and the new event synchronization function (ESF). We test the efficiency of the methods in estimating coupling strength and coupling lag numerically, using ensembles of synthetic stalagmites with short, autocorrelated, linear and nonlinearly coupled proxy time series, and in the application to real stalagmite time series.$\backslash$n In the linear test case, coupling strength increases are identified consistently for all estimators, while in the nonlinear test case the correlation-based approaches fail. The lag at which the time series are coupled is identified correctly as the maximum of the similarity functions in around 60–55{\%} (in the linear case) to 53–42{\%} (for the nonlinear processes) of the cases when the dating of the synthetic stalagmite is perfectly precise. If the age uncertainty increases beyond 5{\%} of the time series length, however, the true coupling lag is not identified more often than the others for which the similarity function was estimated. Age uncertainty contributes up to half of the uncertainty in the similarity estimation process. Time series irregularity contributes less, particularly for the adapted Gaussian-kernel-based estimators and the event synchronization function. The introduced link strength concept summarizes the hypothesis test results and balances the individual strengths of the estimators: while gXCF is particularly suitable for short and irregular time series, gMI and the ESF can identify nonlinear dependencies. ESF could, in particular, be suitable to study extreme event dynamics in paleoclimate records. Programs to analyze paleoclimatic time series for significant dependencies are included in a freely available software toolbox.},

  abstract     = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In real application scenarios, the inherent impreciseness of sensor readings, the intentional perturbation of privacy-preserving transformations, and error-prone mining algorithms cause much uncertainty of time series data. The uncertainty brings serious challenges for the similarity measurement of time series. In this paper, we first propose a model of uncertain time series inspired by Chebyshev inequality. It estimates possible sample value range and central tendency range in terms of sample estimation interval and central tendency estimation interval, respectively, at each time slot. In comparison with traditional models adopting repeated measurements and random variable, Chebyshev model reduces overall computational cost and requires no prior knowledge. We convert Chebyshev uncertain time series into certain time series matrix; therefore noise reduction and dimensionality reduction are available for uncertain time series. Secondly, we propose a new similarity matching method based on Chebyshev model. It depends on overlaps between two sample estimation intervals and overlaps between central tendency estimation intervals from different uncertain time series. At the end of this paper, we conduct an extensive experiment and analyze the results by comparing with prior works.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {Handrim wheelchair propulsion is a cyclic skill that needs to be learned during rehabilitation. Yet it is unclear how inter-individual differences in motor learning impact wheelchair propulsion practice. Therefore we studied how early-identified motor learning styles in novice able-bodied participants impact the outcome of a low-intensity wheelchair-practice intervention. Over a 12-minute pre-test, 39 participants were split in two groups based on a relative 10\% increase in mechanical efficiency. Following the pretest the participants continued one of four different low-intensity wheelchair practice interventions, yet all performed in the same trial-setup with a total 80-minute dose at 1.11 m/s at 0.20 W/kg. Instead of focusing on the effect of the different interventions, we focused on differences in motor learning between participants over the intervention. Twenty-six participants started the pretest with a lower mechanical efficiency and a less optimal propulsion technique, but showed a fast improvement during the first 12 minutes and this effect continued over the 80 minutes of practice. Eventually these initially fast improvers benefitted more from the given practice indicated by a better propulsion technique (like reduced frequency and increased stroke angle) and a higher mechanical efficiency. The initially fast improvers also had a higher intra-individual variability in the pre and posttest, which possibly relates to the increased motor learning of the initially fast improvers. Further exploration of the common characteristics of different types of learners will help to better tailor rehabilitation to the needs of wheelchair-dependent persons and improve our understanding of cyclic motor learning processes.},

The purpose of time-series data mining is to try to extract all meaningful knowledge from the shape of data. Even if humans have a natural capacity to perform these tasks, it remains a complex problem for computers. In this article we intend to provide a survey of the techniques applied for time-series data mining. The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future. We hope that this article can provide a broad and deep understanding of the time-series data mining research field.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Increasingly, biological processes are being studied through time series of RNA expression data collected for large numbers of genes. Because common processes may unfold at varying rates in different experiments or individuals, methods are needed that will allow corresponding expression states in different time series to be mapped to one another. Results: We present implementations of time warping algorithms applicable to RNA and protein expression data and demonstrate their application to published yeast RNA expression time series. Programs executing two warping algorithms are described, a simple warping algorithm and an interpolative algorithm, along with programs that generate graphics that visually present alignment information. We show time warping to be superior to simple clustering at mapping corresponding time states. We document the impact of statistical measurement noise and sample size on the quality of time alignments, and present issues related to statistical assessment of alignment quality through alignment scores. We also discuss directions for algorithm improvement including development of multiple time series alignments and possible applications to causality searches and non-temporal processes ( concentration warping'). Availability: Academic implementations of alignment programs genewarp and genewarpi and the graphics generation programs grphwarp and grphwarpi are available as Win32 system DOS box executables on our web site along with documentation on their use. The publicly available data on which they were demonstrated may be found at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/.

  abstract  = {Mining sequential data is an old topic that has been revived in the last decade, due to the increasing availability of sequential datasets. Most works in this field are centred on the definition and use of a distance (or, at least, a similarity measure) between sequences of elements. A measure called dynamic time warping (DTW) seems to be currently the most relevant for a large panel of applications. This article is about the use of DTW in data mining algorithms, and focuses on the computation of an average of a set of sequences. Averaging is an essential tool for the analysis of data. For example, the K-means clustering algorithm repeatedly computes such an average, and needs to provide a description of the clusters it forms. Averaging is here a crucial step, which must be sound in order to make algorithms work accurately. When dealing with sequences, especially when sequences are compared with DTW, averaging is not a trivial task. Starting with existing techniques developed around DTW, the article suggests an analysis framework to classify averaging techniques. It then proceeds to study the two major questions lifted by the framework. First, we develop a global technique for averaging a set of sequences. This technique is original in that it avoids using iterative pairwise averaging. It is thus insensitive to ordering effects. Second, we describe a new strategy to reduce the length of the resulting average sequence. This has a favourable impact on performance, but also on the relevance of the results. Both aspects are evaluated on standard datasets, and the evaluation shows that they compare favourably with existing methods. The article ends by describing the use of averaging in clustering. The last section also introduces a new application domain, namely the analysis of satellite image time series, where data mining techniques provide an original approach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

classification of time series ignoring this particularity,
we propose a symbolic representation
of cyclic time series based on the properties of
cycles, named SAX-P. The resulting character
strings can be compared using the Dynamic Time
Warping distance. The application of SAX-P to
propulsive moments of three subjects (S1, S2,

asymmetry of their propulsion in a straight line.
The symbolic representation SAX-P facilitates
the reading of the cyclic time series and the interpretation
of the results of their classification

A well-known limitation of SAX is that trends are not taken into account in the symbolization. This paper proposes 1d-SAX a method to represent a time series as a sequence of symbols that each contain information about the average and the trend of the series on a segment. We compare the efficiency of SAX and 1d-SAX in terms of goodness-of-fit, retrieval and classification performance for querying a time series database with an asymmetric scheme. The results show that 1d-SAX improves performance using equal quantity of information, especially when the compression rate increases.},

  abstract     = {Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.},

It is a non-trivial problem because of the inherent high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve first performing dimensionality reduction on the data, and then indexing the reduced data with a spatial access method. Three major dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and more recently the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). We theoretically and empirically compare it to the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. In addition to being competitive with or faster than the other methods, our approach has numerous other advantages. It is simple to understand and to implement, it allows more flexible distance measures, including weighted Euclidean queries, and the index can be built in linear time.},

  abstract     = {The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real valued.Many researchers have also considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these symbolic approaches require one to have access to all the data, before creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts efforts to use the representations with streaming algorithms.In this work we introduce a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only an infinitesimal time and space overhead.We will demonstrate the utility of our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content and anomaly detection.},

@article{Keogh2001,
abstract = {The problem of similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much attention recently. It is a non-trivial problem because of the inherent high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve first performing dimensionality reduction on the data, and then indexing the reduced data with a spatial access method. Three major dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and more recently the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). We theoretically and empirically compare it to the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. In addition to being competitive with or faster than the other methods, our approach has numerous other advantages. It is simple to understand and to implement, it allows more flexible distance measures, including weighted Euclidean queries, and the index can be built in linear time.},

abstract="Dynamic time warping (DTW) has proven itself to be an exceptionally strong distance measure for time series. DTW in combination with one-nearest neighbor, one of the simplest machine learning methods, has been difficult to convincingly outperform on the time series classification task. In this paper, we present a simple technique for time series classification that exploits DTW's strength on this task. But instead of directly using DTW as a distance measure to find nearest neighbors, the technique uses DTW to create new features which are then given to a standard machine learning method. We experimentally show that our technique improves over one-nearest neighbor DTW on 31 out of 47 UCR time series benchmark datasets. In addition, this method can be easily extended to be used in combination with other methods. In particular, we show that when combined with the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) method, it improves over it on 37 out of 47 UCR datasets. Thus the proposed method also provides a mechanism to combine distance-based methods like DTW with feature-based methods like SAX. We also show that combining the proposed classifiers through ensembles further improves the performance on time series classification.",
